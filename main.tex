\begin{abstract}
  This paper is a survey on Graphical Processing Units (GPUs).
  The sections were divided the following way: The introduction and conclusion were collaborative.
  Inji Kim wrote the section on Architecture, Kavish Ranawella wrote the section on Simulators, and Andrew Davis wrote the section on Memory Models.

\section{Introduction}
GPUs are powerful accelerators that are becoming widely used in all aspects of computing, such as machine learning, computational fluid dynamics, image processing, and other general purpose computing on graphics processing units (GPGPU) tasks.
The underlying architecture, memory models, and simulator tools are similar and distinct from a traditional central processing unit (CPU).
In this survey of GPUs we will discuss the underlying architecture, memory models, and the current state of the art GPU simulators.
We will also discuss some of the state of the art improvements to the underlying architecture, memory models, and GPU simulators.
