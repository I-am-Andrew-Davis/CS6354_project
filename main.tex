\begin{abstract}
  This paper is a survey on Graphical Processing Units (GPUs).
  The sections were divided the following way: The introduction and conclusion were collaborative.
  Inji Kim wrote the section on Architecture, Kavish Ranawella wrote the section on Simulators, and Andrew Davis wrote the section on Memory Models.

\section{Introduction}
GPUs are powerful accelerators that are becoming widely used in all aspects of computing, such as machine learning, computational fluid dynamics, image processing, and other general purpose computing on graphics processing units (GPGPU) tasks.
The underlying architecture, memory models, and simulator tools are both similar and distinct from a traditional central processing unit (CPU).
In this survey of GPUs, we will discuss the underlying architecture, memory models, and the current state of the art GPU simulators.
We will also discuss some of the state of the art improvements to the underlying architecture, memory models, and GPU simulators.

The memory models section is organized as follows: an overview of the hierarchy of GPU on chip memory, i.e. caches, shared memory, etc, is discussed, followed by a brief overview of off chip memory, i.e. DRAM.
Some of the state of the art implementations of GPU memory models to be discussed are: memory-coalescing strategies, private vs shared cache design, synchronization strategies, cache coherence, specific findings of underlying memory hardware, virtual memory, and virtual memory addressing schemes.

\section{Conclusion}
We have written an overview of the key components of the GPU, those being, the underlying architecture, the memory models, and the simulators used to test new GPU architecture ideas.
We have also relayed some of the state of the art findings from various academic papers on these concepts.
The following three paragraphs are a brief summary of the concepts detailed in Sections II to IV. The content is organized in the following way: architecture, memory models, and simulators.

Inter-warp memory coalescing was found to be highly efficient by Bakhoda.
Ibrahim found performance gains when shifting from a private L1 cache to a shared L1 cache.
Fung describes a transactional memory policy that is superior to traditional lock-based synchronizations.
Singh explored a method that enabled cache coherence on the GPU, and found their method improved performance of some applications.
Mei and Chu deliver precise experimental findings of the Fermi, Kepler, and Maxwell GPU architectures that were not disclosed by NVIDIA; these findings are primarily on cache behavior, such as eviction policies and cache line size.
Pratheek found a virtual memory system design that improves memory performance for GPUs that use MCM technologies.
Lastly, Liu explored memory addressing modes that perform well on GPUs, these modes are application dependent and take into account an addresses bit entropy region.
